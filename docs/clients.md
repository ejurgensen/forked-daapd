# Supported clients

forked-daapd supports these kinds of clients:

- DAAP clients, like iTunes or Rhythmbox
- Remote clients, like Apple Remote or compatibles for Android/Windows Phone
- AirPlay devices, like AirPort Express, Shairport and various AirPlay speakers
- Chromecast devices
- MPD clients, like mpc (see [mpd-clients](#mpd-clients))
- MP3 network stream clients, like VLC and almost any other music player
- RSP clients, like Roku Soundbridge

Like iTunes, you can control forked-daapd with Remote and stream your music
to AirPlay devices.

A single forked-daapd instance can handle several clients concurrently,
regardless of the protocol.

By default all clients on 192.168.\* (and the ipv6 equivalent) are allowed to
connect without authentication. You can change that in the configuration file.

Here is a list of working and non-working DAAP and Remote clients. The list is
probably obsolete when you read it :-)
